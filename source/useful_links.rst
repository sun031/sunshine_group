Seismological softwares or packages
===================================

General
-------

1. ObsPy http://docs.obspy.org/

ObsPy is an open-source project dedicated to provide a Python framework for 
processing seismological data. 
It provides parsers for common file formats and seismological signal processing routines 
which allow the manipulation of seismological time series.



Simulations
-----------

1. AxiSEM https://geodynamics.org/cig/software/axisem/

AxiSEM AxiSEM is a parallel spectral-element method for 3D (an-)elastic, 
anisotropic and acoustic wave propagation in spherical domains. 
It requires axisymmetric background models and runs within a 2D computational domain, 
thereby reaching all desired highest observable frequencies (up to â€¦

2. SpecFEM2d https://geodynamics.org/cig/software/specfem2d

SPECFEM2D simulates forward and adjoint seismic wave propagation in two-dimensional acoustic, 
(an)elastic, poroelastic or coupled acoustic-(an)elastic-poroelastic media, 
with Convolution PML absorbing conditions.

3. SpecFEM3d https://geodynamics.org/cig/software/specfem3d

SPECFEM3D Cartesian simulates acoustic (fluid), elastic (solid), coupled acoustic/elastic, 
poroelastic or seismic wave propagation in any type of conforming mesh of hexahedra 
(structured or not.) It can, for instance, model seismic waves propagating in 
sedimentary basins or any other regional geological model following earthquakes.

1. Generalized Seismic Phase Detection with Deep Learning 

https://github.com/interseismic/generalized-phase-detection

This is a simple implementation of the Generalized Phase Detection (GPD) framework
 for seismic phase detection with deep learning. GPD uses deep convolutional networks
 to learn generalized representations of millions of P-wave, S-wave, 
and noise seismograms that can be used for phase detection and picking.
